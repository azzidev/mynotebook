# MyNotebook
MyNotebook is a revolutionary innovation that combines the practicality of a digital notebook with the functionality of a calendar. Designed to meet the needs of modern users, this notebook offers an efficient and organized way to keep track of your notes, tasks and appointments over time.

------

To use MyNotebook, you need an Apache/2.4.53 server, PHP7.4 or higher, OpenSSL/1.1.1n and a MariaDB/MySQL database. I recommend using XAMPP or WampServer.

You should clone our repository into the serverâ€™s initial folder:

To find the initial folder in XAMPP, just follow this sequence:

``C:\xampp\htdocs``

To find the initial folder in WampServer, just follow this sequence:

``C:\wamp\www``

Now you need to upload our initial SQL file, it will create the entire database, as well as its tables, settings and necessary privileges.

Download initial SQL file
